The goal of this project is to showcase my personal made code that I have created over time.
### Both desktop and mobile friendly
This website was created using css media queries and
javascript code in order for it to look and act seemlessly
between any device you are viewing it on.

### Was created with flexbox and tables in mind
The majority of the website (including the portolio
content itself) was designed with flexbox. In order
to line up my profile name and profile picture I decided
on using HTML table code in order for it to look the way
I imagined.
